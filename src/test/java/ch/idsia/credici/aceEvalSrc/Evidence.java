/**
 * An object that stores weights for AC use by an
 * {@link OnlineEngine OnlineEngine}.  An evidence object is linked to a
 * specific {@link OnlineEngine OnlineEngine}.  This object performs no
 * inference.  It merely stores weights in a form that can be used
 * efficiently by the engine.  When evidence is constructed, it assigns all
 * weights to defaults, as stored in the literal map.  After construction,
 * weights may be changed.
 * <p>
 * There are two types of weights in the AC.  Each value x of each variable X
 * may have a corresponding indicator weight in the AC.  There will exist such
 * a weight iff X is not a part of evidence used *during compilation*.  When
 * such a weight exists, it is initially set to its default value, typically
 * 1.0, as defined in the literal map.  The default value typically indicates
 * that X=x is possible.  If the weight is changed to 0.0, then that is
 * equivalent to saying that X=x is not possible. Asserting traditional
 * evidence X=x on a variable is equivalent to setting weights for all the
 * variable's values to 0.0 except for the weight corresponding to x, which
 * is set to its default value.
 * <p>
 * Each parameter P in the network may have a corresponding parameter weight
 * in the AC.  There will exist such a weight iff the particular compilation
 * strategy does not commit the parameter to a specific value to make
 * compilation more efficient.  The main point is that different strategies
 * will commit different variables, and so different strategies will make
 * different sets of parameter weights available.  For example, tabular
 * variable elimination will not produce any parameter weights, but logical
 * compilation using the -cd06 encoding will produce a parameter weight for
 * each non-zero parameter that is unique within its CPT (there is no other
 * parameter having equal value).  When such a weight exists, it is initially
 * set to its default value, typically the value of the corresponding
 * parameter, as defined in the literal map.  This weight may be changed
 * however, which is equivalent to changing the value of the parameter in the
 * network.
 * <p>
 * In some cases, it is advantageous to utilize multiple evidence objects.
 * For example, if one wanted to isolate online inference in order to obtain
 * accurate timing, one could construct all evidence sets to be used in
 * queries before performing online inference.  As another example, consider
 * a situation where we execute a loop, and in each iteration, we compute
 * probability of evidence for each of N identical systems, where each system
 * has its own set of observations.  Since the systems are identical, we can
 * use the same OnlineEngine for each.  Moreover, rather than reconstruct the
 * evidence from scratch for each system in each iteration, we could maintain
 * one evidence object for each system, and in each iteration, only
 * <em>update</em> each evidence object with <em>changes</em> in the
 * corresponding system, which would be simpler and somewhat more efficient.
 * In other cases, a single evidence set may work best.  For example, if
 * performing a branch-and-bound search for an instantiation of MAP
 * variables, one may wish to commit a single assignment and retract a single
 * assignment at each search node.
 * <p>
 * A major goal when performing arithmetic circuit inference is efficiency.
 * When the arithmetic circuit is sufficiently large, the time to set up
 * evidence will be insignificant, even when care is not taken.  However,
 * when an arithmetic circuit is small compared to the number of variables, the
 * time to set up evidence may be more significant.  If the time to set up
 * evidence turns out to be significant, then there are several things that
 * could be done to improve the situation.  First, try to reduce the number of
 * invocations of
 * {@link OnlineEngine#varForName(String) OnlineEngine.varForName(String)} (
 * {@link OnlineEngine#potForName(String) OnlineEngine.potForName(String)}),
 * calling it at most once for a given variable (potential) if at all
 * possible during initialization rather than once (or multiple times) inference
 * is performed.  It may also help to reduce the number of calls to methods
 * within this class, especially {@link #Evidence(OnlineEngine)
 * Evidence(OnlineEngine)} and {@link #retractAll() retractAll()}, each of which
 * executes in time that is linear in the number of AC variables, which can be
 * as large as the Bayesian network from which the AC was produced.  Strategies
 * for improving efficiency include making use of multiple evidence objects
 * where doing so will help, updating evidence instead of creating it from
 * scratch where doing so will help, and reusing evidence objects instead of
 * creating new ones where doing so will help.
