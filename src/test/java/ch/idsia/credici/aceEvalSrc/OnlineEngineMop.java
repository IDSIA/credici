/**
 * An OnlineEngine capable of answering repeated max-of-product (MOP)
 * probabilistic queries efficiently.  Supported MOP queries currently
 * include:
 * <ul>
 * <li> the MOP value
 * <li> partial derivatives
 * <li> marginals
 * <li> posterior marginals
 * <li> the number of MOP instantiations
 * <li> the set of MOP instantiations (or a subset)
 * </ul>
 * For a MOP engine compiled from a Bayesian network, the evaluation result is
 * equivalent to the MPE probability.
 * <p>
 * After we have evaluated, we can also differentiate in time that is linear in
 * the size of the circuit.  Afterward, we can additionally retrieve, for each
 * value of each network variable, and for each position of each potential, a
 * partial derivative, a marginal, and a posterior marginal.
 * <p>
 * After we have evaluated, we can also enumerate in time that is linear in the
 * size of the circuit.  Afterward, we can additionally retrieve the number of
 * MOP instantiations, and we can compute the ith instantiation.  When computing
 * multiple instantiations, work performed by the previous invocation will not
 * be redone, so it is most efficient to compute instantiations in order.  For
 * example:
 * <code>
 *   mopInstantiation.evaluate();
 *   mopInstantiation.enumerate();
 *   for (int i = 0; i &lt; mopEngine.count(); ++i) {
 *     HashMap&lt;Variable, Integer\&gt; m = mopEngine.instantiation(i);
 *     }
 *   }
 * </code>
 * <p>
 * The implementation for this class is trivial.  Each method invokes a method
 * in the superclass.  The purpose of this class is to define which operations
 * are available for the particular compile kind by selectively making
 * operations in the superclass public.
